# php_text_encryption
This is a text encryption code written entirely in PHP. It is meant to be used with other PHP applications in so as to encrypt passwords and the likes. The reason for this code is that at a point in time, the PHP Password Hash function was not capable of doing what was needed so an improvision was needed. The code can also decrypt encrypted texts.
